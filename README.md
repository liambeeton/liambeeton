Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a father, husband, programmer, and general geek.

I work primarily in `C#` but am familiar with `Golang`, `JavaScript`, and `Kotlin`.
Experienced in cloud service models including `SaaS`, `PaaS`, and `IaaS`.
Proficient in `Kubernetes` with hands-on experience in deployment and management.
Dabble in `Rust`, but I've never thrown a real problem at it.
